<h1>Chemical Bonds</h1> 
<p><img class="special" src="scienceRules.jpeg" alt="Science Tools"/></p>
<p>Chemical bonds are what we call the force that holds atoms together. In chemistry, scientists study the different forces that cause the atoms to attract.  There are essentially four different types of chemical bonds: metallic, ionic, polar, and non-polar bonds. Polar and non-polar bonds are both a type of covalent bond. Each one can be classified by distinct features.
</p>

<h3>Covalent Bonds</h3>
<p>
Covalent bonds share electrons between the two atoms. The difference comes when the electrons are shared. When the sharing of electrons is equal, it would be classified as a polar bond. A good example of this is water, or H20. When the electrons are shared unequally, it would be a nonpolar bond. 
</p>

<h3>Ionic Bonds</h3>
<p>
If covalent bonds are shared, then ionic bonds are the opposite. The electrons in an ionic bond are taken back and forth from each other. Each atom is then called an ion depending on whether it's taking an electron or losing an electron. The ions are the parts that are being attracted to each other.
</p>

<h3>Metallic Bond</h3>
<p>The last type of bond is a metallic bond which is found within metal elements. Metallic bonds hold metallic atoms together and give those elemects metallic properties such as strength, mallaeability, ductility, heat and electricy conduction, etc.
