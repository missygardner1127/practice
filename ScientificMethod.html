<h1>The Scientific Method</h1>
<p>
	The scientific method is a series of steps that can be easily followed to find answers to questions and test different things. Whether you are determining the effects of sunlight on plants or the cause of a child's fear when their mother leaves, the scientific method can standardize and guide your research. The simplest way to understand the scientific method is to break it down into six steps.

<h3>Six steps of the Scientific Method</h3>
<p><img src="tristan.jpg" alt="Tristan looking at beaker"/></p>
<ol>
	<li>Come up with a question</li>
	<li>Form a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypothesis">hypothesis 
	</a> based on knowledge or research. This should be what you think the anwer to your question is.</li>
	<li>Test your hypothesis with an experiment.</li>
	<li>Anazlyze the experiment's results.</li>
	<li>Draw conclusions from your findings.</li>
	<li>Share those results with others.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Applying the Scientific Method</h3>

<p>Looking back at the example of plants and sunlight, let's determine what each step might look like.
Our question would be, "What is the effect of sunlight on plants?" Next, we would form a hypothesis which is what we'll be testing. In order to understand the effects of sunlight on plants, we might take 2 plants of the same species and plant them in two of the same type of pots, but we'll change their environment. One plant and pot will be placed in a dark box on a window sill, while the other will be placed next to it but not in a box. Our hypothesis might be, "We think the plant outside of the box will grow taller, while the plant inside the box will grow less than the plant outside." We would then do what we planned with each plant and watch their progress. It's important to be consistent in measuring and recording the data. At the end of our experiment, we might find that the plant outside the box grew 4 inches over the month of the experiment while the plant inside the box grew 1 inch, and then died. We would conclude that plants with exposure to sunlight grow and live better and longer than plants that don't receive sunlight. We would then share our results with others who had the same question</p>
